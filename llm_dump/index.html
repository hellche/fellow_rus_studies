In Russia, the revival didn't happen. We offer here some partial explanations. First, mass privatization is likely to lead to massive self-dealing by managers and controlling shareholders unless (implausibly in the initial transition from central planning to markets) a country has a good infrastructure for controlling self-dealing Russia accelerated the self-dealing process by selling control of its largest enterprises cheaply to crooks, who transferred their skimming talents to the enterprises they acquired, and used their wealth to further corrupt the government and block reforms that might constrain their actions. Second profit incentives to restructure privatized businesses and create new ones can be swamped by the burden on business imposed by a combination of (among other things) a punitive tax system, official corruption, organized crime, and an unfriendly bureaucracy. Third, while self-dealing will still occur (though perhaps to a lesser extent) if state enterprises aren't privatized. since self-dealing accompanies privatization, it politically discredits privatization as a reform strategy and can undercut longer-term reforms. A principal lesson: developing the institutions to control self-dealing is central to successful privatization of large firms.","We use the Soviet state and party archives to study the creation of the Soviet financial system. Although its framers intended to centralize all emission and monitoring of money and credit, in practice the system was characterized by informal mechanisms involving multiple players, soft budget constraints, and massive moral hazards. Enterprises issued \"illegal\" commercial credits and surrogate monies, causing liquidity growth to far outpace real economic activity. When confronted with the choice of solvency versus plan fulfillment, firms always chose the latter: credit risks were passed on to solvent enterprises, the state bank, and the state budget.","The Hashimoto doctrine for Northeast Asia proclaimed by the Japanese Prime-Minister in June 1997 promised a rapid improvement in Japanese-Russian relations. Intensification of the bilateral dialogue culminating at the informal summit at Krasnoyarsk in November 1997 increased high expectations after Russian President Boris Yeltsin pledged to \"do his best\" to sign the peace treaty by the year 2000; nevertheless, negotiations have been at a stalemate since the subsequent meeting in April 1998.","The task of both foreign policy makers and foreign policy scholars is complicated by the appearance on the international stage of a 'new actor,' about whom little information is available. The lack of information concerning such 'new actors' makes the job of explaining, predicting, and influencing that decision-maker's choices many times more difficult. It is the argument of this paper that a multi-disciplinary approach, combining the political-psychology concept of an individual's 'Operational Code' with the policy tasks of formulating guidelines for those who must deal with such 'new actors,' offers a way to overcome this problem. The case of Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation and a classic 'new actor,' is explored in depth on these terms.","In 1991, a small group of Russians emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union to claim ownership, of some of the world's most valuable oil, natural gas, and metal deposits. This resulted in one of the greatest transfers of wealth ever seen. By 1997, five of these individuals, who in the 1980s had only negligible net worth, were listed by Forbes as among the world's richest billionaires. This year seventeen of these men were on the Forbes list, including two who merged their companies to create what promises to be an oil conglomerate worth $35 billion. Almost all of these self-styled oligarchs have been accused of guile, intimidation, and even murder in reaping their rewards. Not surprisingly, their rise-and for some, their fall-mirrors the travails of the Russian economy.","There has been very little research on the rights of numerically small peoples of the North, Siberia, and Far East of the Russian Federation. Even though legislation has recently passed that improves their legal rights and notwithstanding the respect for indigenous cultures, the article reveals a considerable gap between general relevant standards of international law and the real situation of these peoples. Ultimate lack of political will and focus on national economic development maintain discriminatory patterns, discourage any real participation of these communities in decisions that affect them, prolong the violations against their land rights and ultimately endanger their survival.","Two economic geographers specializing in the mineral resources of the former Soviet Union and Russia discuss a paper on Russian oil published in this journal by a seasoned observer of this critical subject since the early 1970s. The authors comment on the behavior of Russian oil companies such as Yukos, Russian economic policy in mid-2004, and the role of foreign companies, capital, and advanced technology. Recalling mistaken estimates of declining Soviet oil output in the late 1970s, they outline factors that suggest a somewhat more optimistic outcome could be possible, but note that the drift toward government control, which runs counter to the oil industry's efficiency, is not a positive sign.","Recent empirical analyses of the relationship between financial system development and economic growth find that financial system development causes economic growth, is a good predictor of growth and that its impact is relatively large. Moreover, the empirical literature predicts that the adverse effects of banking crises on economic growth will rise in the absence of an adequate response by the government. Hence, given the Russian government's failure to respond adequately to the 1998 banking crisis, Russia's strong economic growth since the crisis is a puzzle. This study uses simulations to conclude that the growth costs of the 1998 crisis were larger than previously suggested. The adverse effects were compensated by expansionary effects. The findings corroborate the importance of financial development in promoting growth in transition countries.","Nuclear weapons' defenders claim that they lower the risk of war, at the price of devastation if war breaks out. Sooner or later, however, on a realist analysis, catastrophic nuclear war is sure to come. Nuclear deterrence thus buys us a better chance of dying in bed, while each post-holocaust generation will have to pick up the pieces. If the nuclear optimists are wrong, hoping to spread or perpetuate nuclear deterrence is foolish; but if they are right, it is exploitative. Like big cars and cheap flights, nuclear deterrence benefits us at the expense of future generations. States that do not already have the bomb should not get it. Britain and France should consider disarmament, while Russia and the United States should slash their arsenals. Minimum deterrence should be equally stable, but most nuclear optimists, being neorealists who hold that war will continue, should want deep cuts even if it is not.","Russia in 2007 moved further away from a constitutional order governed by the rule of law as President Vladimir Putin's second term drew to a close and the country prepared for parliamentary and presidential elections. High oil and gas prices buoyed the economy, but little progress was made in addressing Russia's serious social problems. In foreign policy, confrontation with the West was balanced by excellent relations with most of Asia.","In this article, the author discusses the problem of ensuring equality and non-discrimination in a legal system. Equality and non-discrimination constitute universally recognized standards in the protection of human rights. At the same time, one can hardly assert that the universal community has put an end to discrimination. The author considers the problem as applied to the Russian legal system. The standard is incorporated in the Russian Constitution and in Russian legislation. However, ensuring equality and non-discrimination still remains topical in Russia. Based on his analysis of legislation and judicial practice, the author concludes that the problem reveals itself on the levels of both law-making and law application, the latter including administration of justice. As one of the conclusion, the author raises a question: is legal discrimination inherent in a legal system like other negative phenomena, such as delinquency, incoherencies, lacunas, defects, conflicts of legal norms and breaches of law-making procedural rules?","It is widely acknowledged that Russia possesses enormous biomass resources (Hoogwijk et al., 2005). Its vast areas devoted to agricultural production and plentiful timber resources suggest good prospects for the development of liquid biofuel production. However, no significant advances in this direction have been reported till now. None of the numerous investment projects announced at the heydays of biofuel excitement in Russia (2006-2008) are at the moment commercially operating. There are no specialised plants for the production of bioethanol and biodiesel in Russia. Little is known of the reasons for this discrepancy between biofuel potential and actual development. In investigating this discrepancy, this article analyses national developments and investigates local dynamics through a case-study in the Omsk region. It is found that the reasons for this discrepancy are not related to technological incapabilities, but are to be found in the low policy and institutional priority given to non-fossil fuel exploitation and lack of market opportunities. Sprouts of second generation liquid biofuel technologies can be identified within the state system, but it remains to be seen how strong and how long these will be supported by the Russian state.","Indigenous peoples have been struggling to maintain or regain rights to land, identity, and culture in the face of colonialism. In Russia, government policies have pushed European Russian/Soviet nationalism in an attempt to diminish or erase non-European identity. But there has been insurgency. We present the case of Buryat historical and contemporary insurgent planning. We contextualize indigenous insurgent planning using colonialism and identity as backdrops. Drawing on sixteen months of ethnographic study and review of historical sources, we tell the stories of how many Buryats use dynamic indigenous identities combined with appropriated Russian nomenclature to resist and negotiate postmodern imperialism.","This study provides requisite information on the thorny civil war and destructive situation in the Republic of Sudan, which has led to the indictment of the sitting Sudanese Head of State in 2009. This paper will provide an in depth discussion regarding increased weapons transfers and its adverse impact on the conflict in Sudan. Additionally, theoretical frameworks regarding the foreign policies of nation-states, power, and resource conflict will be utilized to analyze the Sudanese government's relationships with China, Russia and Iran as well as its relationship with the marginalized communities of the Sudan such as Darfur and the Nuba Mountains. Information has been provided to underscore the major players in the conflict, whereby Russia, Iran and China are considered culprits in the arms race in the area. Russia, China and Iran have continued to supply arms to Sudan despite the institution of a UN arms embargo in 2004. Although the weapons procurement chain in Sudan demands a comprehensive analysis of both state and non-state actors a close examination of its relationship with various nation-states such as China, Iran and Russia will provide a greater understanding of the economic and political environment that has contributed to the increase of weapons transfers which has adversely impacted internal and regional security","This article explores the insights literature can bring to administrative and bureaucratic critique, focusing on the work of Nikolai Gogol. Gogol's satire of bureaucracy presages many subsequent social science analyses. These encompass the fundamental ruptures in society caused by a surfeit of bureaucracy in 'The Nose' and, on a more psychological level, the effects of bureaucratization on the individual in 'The Overcoat'. His stories portray the alienation, futile activity and servility caused in lower level functionaries through problems of loss of identity, the absence of meaningful work and a lack of separation between public and private life. This article uses Gogol's work to intensify and sharpen an exploration of the pathological responses of educational administrators and policy makers to an accountability era of burgeoning bureaucracy that has a profound negative impact on performance.","This article surveys nation-building efforts in post-Soviet Russia. There have been five main nation-building projects reflecting the dominant ways of imagining the 'true' Russian nation but each has been fraught with contradictions and therefore have been unable to easily guide state policies. At the same time, a solution to the Russian nation-building dilemma may be emerging. This solution does not resolve the contradictions associated with each of the nation-building agendas but instead legalises the ambiguous definition of the nation's boundaries in the 1999 law on compatriots and the 2010 amendments to it. The fuzzy definition of compatriots in the law allows Russia to pursue a variety of objectives and to target a variety of groups without solving the contradictions of existing nation-building discourses.","This article investigates the use of favors by managers of BRIC firms to accomplish business goals, the ethicality of which should be determined by the moral reasoning in these countries rather than from a developed country perspective. We define a favor as an exchange of outcomes between individuals, typically utilizing one's connections, that is based on a commonly understood cultural tradition, with reciprocity by the receiver typically not being immediate, and its value being less than what would constitute bribery within that cultural context. This exchange normally takes place between and among members of networks, and may involve a network outsider contacted by a network insider on behalf of another insider. We see the giver and receiver of the favor, as well as network insiders and outsiders, as stakeholders. Additionally, society could also be considered to be a stakeholder since the practice of using favors generally inhibits the development of legitimate, strong formal institutions, since the use of favors in emerging economies is rooted in cultural traditions that we view as informal institutions. Furthermore, we assert that the practice of using favors can lead to bribery which harms society as a stakeholder both morally and economically. We posit that BRIC-country managers' behaviors stem from informal, culturally based practices-jeito in Brazil, blat/sviazi in Russia, jaan-pehchaan in India, and guanxi in China. We utilize institutional theory to explain why favors are relied upon, and ISCT to support the argument that the use of favors in environments like the BRICs is generally considered ethical.","Judging by officially published figures, the socioeconomic development of Russia appears relatively successful, especially compared to the 1990s. However, a more detailed analysis of the situation on the basis of indicators that reflect fundamental social and economic processes convinces us that the Russian economy and society are on the brink of collapse. This paper by Academician S.Yu. Glaz'ev and Professor V. Lokosov, delivered at an RAS Presidium meeting, was devoted to this problem. They proposed a new approach to the assessment of the socioeconomic system. We also publish the expanded text of their paper and its discussion.","The article analyses Russia's Eastern energy strategy in the sectors of oil and natural gas, presenting its main aspects and examining it from the security perspective against the backdrop of official Russian documents. The goals set by the strategy are compared with the steps presently taken and planned by the Russian administration, as well as with short- and medium-term Russian energy policies in the sectors of oil and natural gas. The authors conclude that implementation of the Energy Strategy to 2030 in the sectors of oil and natural gas will be highly complicated in the Eastern vector of Russian politics and achievable only if new deposits are found.","This article deals with the main directions of development of Russia's forensics and theory of criminalistics from the beginning of the 21st century. A social revolution in Russia occurred in the early 1990's, and the new Constitution declared Russia to be a state of law and justice, and proclaimed the rule of law and the priority of human rights and freedom. According to these proclaimed priorities, massive judicial and legal reforms were instituted, and are still lasting. Russia began progressing from the investigating type of criminal procedure to a more controversial one. The changes that took place in the home and foreign policy have had a great influence upon the contemporary Russian criminalistics as well. The adaptation to new conditions of legal reality became a main task of Russian criminalistics in the last few years. The article discusses the modification of Russian criminalistics (both forensic and scientific researches).","This article asserts that Russian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) contribute to processes of transitional justice in Chechnya through their litigation in front at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Having delivered more than 200 judgments on atrocities which occurred during the two recent conflicts in Chechnya, the ECtHR has repeatedly ruled that the state should pay financial compensation to the victims. While the Russian Federation has been following through on such payments, human-rights monitors allege that domestic authorities have failed to take active measures to address the atrocities themselves.","The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, euphemistically called the \"Ukraine crisis\", draws attention to its ideological underpinnings that include a historically informed Russian hegemonic view of Ukrainians as \"younger brothers\" who should be both patronized and censured for improper behavior. The paper examines a particular aspect of this superior attitude as embedded in ethnic stereotypes - both \"vernacular\", primarily in folklore, and ideologically constructed, in both cultural and political discourses. In both cases, the structure of stereotypes reflects the dominant position of one group and subjugated position of the other within a more general paradigm of relations between Robinson Crusoe and Friday. A peculiar dialectics implies that a \"good\" Friday can be civilized and assimilated and become almost equal to Crusoe - \"almost the same people\", in a popular Russian parlance about Ukrainians. Yet, a \"bad\" (\"wrong\") Friday should be strongly reviled and thoroughly demonized as a complete evil, manipulated allegedly by hostile (\"Western\") Robinsons. The paper argues that the Russo-Ukrainian relations cannot be normalized until Russians learn to see Ukrainians as neither \"good\" nor \"bad\" but just different - as all the people around.","Survey evidence suggests that Vladimir Putin's legitimacy rests on three pillars: domestic order; economic prosperity; and the demonstration of great power status internationally. This is problematic inasmuch as it is based on a high degree of personal popularity which inhibits and contravenes the legal-rational legitimacy of state institutions. This requires continued delivery in all three areas in order to maintain the legitimacy of the regime. This framework allows us better to interpret the 2014 Ukraine crisis as an attempt to shore up support in one pillar' as performance-based legitimacy recedes.","Missing abstract?","The beginnings of Pugwash overlapped with the first stage of the process of de-Stalinization, which had a marked effect on science and on scientific cooperation across the Iron Curtain. In the international context of the late 1950s, Pugwash enabled Soviet officials and scientists to play an active part in the international community at the very point when the World Peace Council (a Soviet front organization) was experiencing its deepest crisis. Despite political pressure from Moscow, the various Academies of Sciences in East European countries, which represented Pugwash national committees in their respective societies, managed to benefit from these circumstances. They developed important contacts with Western analysts such as Henry Kissinger, Paul Doty, and Marshall Shulman. This cooperation helped to shape the research agenda in Eastern Europe, though its scope was still controlled by the USSR. Nevertheless, after 1975and most importantly after 1982Pugwash managed to establish contact with non-Communist peace activists and dissident movements in Eastern Europe.","This article tries to analyze two major problems for the moral-spiritual life of the native population from the Prut-Dniester interfluve. First, we know that, in the 19th century, and in the respective geographic area, the resistance of the Romanian population played an important role in what we can call Russian Imperial Orthodoxy, which the authorities attempted to use as an instrument for the complete incorporation of the respective population into the Russian Empire. The second part of the article refers to the Soviet confessional policy carried out on this territory, or indeed to a particular aspect of this policy, the one related to designing the which were to fully substitute the religiousness of native population.","The study offers new empirical material to link student mobility and the levels of attained democracy in the former Soviet countries. Theoretically-informed analysis of cross-sectional data shows that the former Soviet countries with higher proportions of students studying in Europe or the United States have achieved higher levels of democratic development. In contrast, countries with higher proportions of students studying in the most popular, authoritarian destination - Russia - have reached significantly lower levels of democratic development. The study uses ideas of democratic socialisation at universities as well as apprenticeships in democracy to advance the intellectual agenda of linking two fields - educational studies and political science.","Intellectual efforts to understand post-Crimean Russian society have brought to prominence explanations that emphasize psychological and attitudinal legacies of Soviet society. The recent revival of the term homo sovieticus (or Soviet man) in the media and intellectual discourse is a good illustration of this trend. Yurii Levada's late-Soviet sociological research project on the \"simple Soviet man\" serves as a frequent reference point in these discussions. In this article, I explore the ideological and analytical foundations of the Levada project and juxtapose the sociological construct developed by Levada and his team with the interpretative approach developed by Natalya Kozlova, another Soviet scholar who dedicated her life to studying Soviet society. I argue that essentialist and deterministic views of individual personality underpinning the Levada project that guide the current use of the Soviet man category are more politically and ideologically driven rather than being based on the state of the art in social psychology.","This article engages in an analysis of contemporary relations between civic actors and state power structures, notably the military organization, in the Russian Federation. The main focus is on the complex tension and interaction between state-sanctioned forms of control of the armed forces and public control, exercised by grassroots actors. The underlying assumption is that an institutionalization of control of state power structures is taking place in Russia. The article seeks to understand whether these processes are prevalently a top-down or a bottom-up phenomenon, how public control as a \"civic duty\" can be effectively characterized, and what implications this has for Russian civic activism more generally.","The greatest nuclear proliferation risk today arises from the lack of adequate physical protection, control and accounting of weapon usable materials in Russia.  The most effective way to improve physical security and material accounting in Russia is through a cooperative effort to construct a comprehensive, non-discriminatory regime that ultimately would place all nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon usable materials under some form of multilateral monitoring.  There is an urgent need for government action in states that now have significant programs involving the commercial use of nuclear weapon usable materials to defer further separation of plutonium until the global inventory of separated plutonium is significantly reduced and energy market conditions fully justify the added security risks of using plutonium in the civil fuel cycle.","The dissolution of the former Soviet Union has been accompanied by the outbreak of intra-state conflicts at various places., As the principal successor state, Russia claims responsibility for containment of these conflicts and seeks both international legitimization and foreign support for her respective efforts. There is, however, much suspicion in the region that Moscow actually pursues neo-imperial ambitions. The problems are analyzed by Michael R. Lucas, a Senior Research Fellow of the World Policy Institute in New York.","During and after World War II, Soviet leaders ordered a massive transfer of library holdings and art from German territory to the Soviet Union, establishing ''trophy commissions'' that organized the systematic removal of public and private collections and allocated them to Soviet libraries, archives, and museums. Some materials were permanently integrated into Russian holdings, but others were poorly stored and forgotten, for lack of staff and space to process them. Only now, as previously secret documents are becoming available to scholars, is it possible to begin to determine what was transferred where, by whose authority, by what methods, and to what ends. The author suggests it is time, fifty years after the end of the war, for Germans and Russians to aid each other in locating and returning missing cultural property.","Russian Orthodoxy, Christian Socialism, and Russian Communism are consistent in their denunciation of Homo Economicus - the Western ideal type celebrating individual properties and instrumental rationality. Russian religious and cultural rejections of Home Economicus and Western-style contract are counterpoised by the constructions of Home Orthodox and Russian covenant, that exalt communitarianism and transcendental value convictions.","When the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston chose \"Rethinking the International Monetary System\" as the topic for its 43rd Economic Conference, it was clear that the worst international financial crisis in decades bad caused tremors within the economics profession and the policymaking establishment. The miracle countries of Asia had suffered sharp currency devaluation and deep economic downturns, the turmoil had spilled over into Russia and Latin America, and a severe liquidity crisis had briefly threatened banking systems in the advanced countries. Not surprisingly, then, the events of the 1990s provoked many proposals for reform. But these proposals reflected differing, even contradictory views about the underlying problems and their solutions, and they did not always reveal a systemic approach to reform.","The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) served as an important social stratification mechanism. With the collapse of the Soviet state and the transition from state socialism in Russia, the institutional basis for former CPSU members' advantages disappeared. Thus, if former members still enjoy higher earnings than nonmembers, their advantages must stem from their superior human capital, social capital, or the unmeasured attributes that helped them join the Party in the first place. Using the Russian component of the multinational survey, \"Social Stratification in Eastern Europe after 1989: General Population Survey,\" I model the effects of Party membership on the personal incomes of Russian adults in summer 1993, 1.5 years after the Soviet collapse. OLS regressions indicate that former Party members enjoy an income advantage after the collapse of Communism, net of other variables. Endogenous switching regressions reveal that this advantage stems entirely from selection into the Parry on the basis of unobserved variables. Net of the selection effect, there is no residual return to Parry membership. The findings imply that institutional change in formerly Communist systems does not fully account for who gets ahead: some individuals can adapt to changed institutional contexts so as to Preserve their advantages.

In line with theoretical predictions, the study shows that downsizing is strongly influenced by industry-specific factors, and it is positively associated with outside, noninstitutional shareholding. However, a firm's ability to downsize is negatively associated with the extent of managerial shareholding, a finding consistent with managerial entrenchment.","Pupils' poor achievement in number in England has been indicated by research involving international comparisons. Such findings have contributed to an increased interest in mathematics teaching in other countries. This article presents the initial results of a comparative study of mathematics lessons in Sunderland and St Petersburg. The research focuses upon an analysis of the shape and structure of mathematics lessons in the two countries and identifies common features and characteristic routines. These suggest a contrast between the public interaction typical of Russian lessons and the private nature of much interaction in the middle phase of English lessons. Whereas Russian lessons are composed of a greater number of shorter sections, English lessons have a characteristic long section during which pupils work independently and have a greater responsibility for controlling the pace of the learning. It is suggested that a comparative analysis of the two models can usefully stimulate thinking about forms of social constructivism in practice.","A French economist uses official Russian data sources to analyze Russia's economic situation since the financial crisis of 1998. The causes of and possible threats to the recent rebound as well as short-term, mid-range, and long-term policy options for stable growth are examined. Broader political considerations and global economic trends are linked to the examination and prediction of Russia's economic policies and prospects.","The introduction of mass privatization policies in Russia and the Czech Republic depended on the creation of impersonal capital markets to finance the needs of privatized companies and to provide a secondary market for the trading of securities. Yet, mass privatization created the contradictory conditions of generating millions of poorly informed shareholders, with no efficient markets for the sale of the shares. The absence of financial markets created systematic pressures to move assets by illegal or non-transparent means to users who value them more. Privatization created the incentives to destroy the financial markets critical to its success. A comparative case analysis of post-privatization market formation in both these countries demonstrates that the functional necessity for these markets does not engender their own creation. In the absence of institutional mechanisms of state regulation and trust, markets become arenas for political contests and economic manipulation. The irony of these policies is that a principal lesson has been that market reforms cannot create viable markets, only institutional formation can.","In this article, Sheila Fitzpatrick investigates the phenomenon of Soviet conmanship in the Stalin period through the medium of conman stories, both real (as reported in newspapers and archives) and fictional. While attention is paid to the distinctive characteristics of conman stories as a discursive genre, the main emphasis is on the social. The article explores the sources and processes of the Soviet confidence trick, as well as showing how conmen and their exploits illuminate social, bureaucratic, and cultural practices. In the comparison of prewar and postwar periods, the \"Jewishing\" of the conman in postwar representation is discussed and related to the broader phenomenon of officially encouraged anti-Semitism in the late Stalin period.","This article addresses the question of the impact of governmental retraining programs on immigrants' occupational incorporation. It proposes that immigrants' loss of occupational status relates to decredentialization resulting from their foreign credentials' being devalued and proposes viewing participation in governmental retraining programs as a process of recredentialization. The findings indicate the important role government can play in enhancing the occupational status of immigrants through recredentialiation. Nine hundred ten immigrants from the former Soviet Union to Israel in the 1990s were interviewed in 1992 and again in 1995 to examine the effect of their participation in retraining programs on occupational integration and improving earnings. The effects were studied for salaried immigrants. The findings are discussed in light of the institutional perspective and the theories of human capital, screening theory, and credentialism.","An American specialist on Russian politics and federalism examines the democratizing effects, intended and unintended, of President Vladimir Putin's federative reforms. Focus is on the \"harmonization\" of regional constitutions and legislation with federal laws and the RF Constitution in the name of the \"reintegration of Russia's legal space.\" On the basis of detailed analysis of changes in regional constitutions and laws ensuing from the harmonization policy, the author assesses the impact of this aspect of the reforms on democratization in Russia's regions. Regional issues examined include the separation and balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, political and civil rights, the level of demand for democratic laws and independent judicial review, and the emergence of stakeholders of these reforms within civil society.","Long a tradition in the USA, surveys of citizen perceptions of the police are beginning to gain prominence in emerging democracies. Recently, citizen surveys using common items were conducted in New York, and St Petersburg, Russia. This paper reports on a cross-national analysis of data on citizen perceptions of the police using data from these two surveys. The analyses include comparisons of voluntary and involuntary contacts with the police, perceptions of police effectiveness, and perceptions of police misconduct. Results suggest that residents of St Petersburg are more likely to be stopped by the police, while residents of New York are more likely to contact the police for assistance with crime and other neighborhood problems. Police in New York were generally seen as more effective than their counterparts in St Petersburg. In both cities, roughly half of those surveyed believed that the police engaged in misconducl.","This essay locates Russian revolutionary agency in a scenographic solution, specifically in Lyubov Popova's constructivist set for Vsevolod Meyerhold's 1922 production of The Magnanimous Cuckold. Filtering Crommelynck's tragiface (which dramatizes the consequences of imagined marital infidelity) through a filter of formalist staging and design that featured geometric shapes and linguistic signs enabled Meyerhold to treat provocatively the postrevolutionary themes of disillusionment, (mis)representation and individual consciousness in a collectivist society. Meyerhold's theatricalist mise en scene interrogated state-supported and non-state-supported theoretical principles of aesthetics, social, and individual constructedness. The formalist theories of Viktor Shklovsky, who introduced the concepts of 'Art as Device' and 'defamiliarization' in Russia in 1917, and the thematically allied theories of Mikhail Bakhtin helped to frame and to spin this multifaceted discussion.","The Beat Movement has long been thought to centre only as an American cultural phenomenon and in key names like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso, and with William Burroughs as a presiding dark mentor. This essay argues for a far wider contextual understanding. It looks to Beat currents in the African American poetry of LeRoi Jones/Imamu Baraka, Ted Joans and Bob Kaufman, a circuit of Beat-influenced women like Diane Di Prima and Anne Waldman, and a US multicultural arena to include Oscar Zeta Acosta and Maxine Hong Kingston. Most of all it analyses the Beat impact beyond America in three prime names: Andrei Voznesensky as leading 1960s1970s Russian dissident poet, Kazuko Shiraishi as longtime vintage Tokyoite jazz-and-poetry bad girl, and Michael Horovitz as British counter-culture voice. In these three Beat acquires a global reach, a force of vision, a poetics, well beyond Greenwich Village or City Lights Bookshop, San Francisco. It also links the local, miniaturist Pocket Poets series established by Ferlinghetti with his own Pictures of a Gone World (1955) to Beat writings which can best be thought at once national and transnational. Given this larger cultural context, the essay analyzes a relevant body of verse by Vosnesensky, Shiraishi and Horovitz, with particular attention given to vision, image, the shaping language each poet gives to Beat heritage inaugurated far from their own beginnings.","The Ballets Russrs of Serge Diaghilev has frequently been hailed as an emblem of 20th-century modernism, its productions created by a \"committee\" of directors, composers, and designers viewed as a realization of an elusive dream of art synthesis. Present research based on diverse unpublished sources traces the beginning of the transition toward modernism on stage to the earlier activities of the Moscow Private Opera directed by Savva Mamontov. An artist and a millionaire, Mamontov Succeeded in realizing his ideal of opera as a synthesized art form by instigating major reforms in acting, directing, and design, all later adopted by Diaghilev However, parallels between their two enters prises have always been dismissed as coincidental. New evidence reveals the existence of a mentor-student relationship between Marnontov and Diaghilev based on shared aesthetic views that earned both men a derogatory, label of \"decadents.\" Intrigued by Mamontov's philosophy and collaborative methodology employed in creating productions such as Gluck's Orfeo and Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko, Diaghilev studied organizational principles of his enterprise and modeled the Ballets Russes after them, while himself assuming the role of an artistic director similar to Mamontov's. Thus, Savva Marnontov paved the way for the modernist vision of theater presented to the world by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.","Differences in the evolution of Polish and Russian income distributions in the post-socialist era can be attributed to different rates of entry of new enterprises. Using regional differences during early privatization as instruments to estimate the impact of this entry, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the share of the workforce in new or small enterprises increases the share of income earned by the lowest forty percent of the population by 1.4% and by 1.25% in Polish and Russian regions, respectively. Poland's greater success in de novo firm entry contributes to its more equitable income distribution during the transition.","Fleurbaey et al. (2003) develop a bounded dominance test to make robust welfare comparisons, which is intermediate between Ebert's (1999) cardinal dominance criterion-generalized Lorenz dominance applied to household incomes, divided and weighted by an equivalence scale-and Bourguignon's (1989) ordinal dominance criterion. In this paper, we develop a more complete, but less robust bounded index test, which is intermediate between Ebert's (1997) cardinal index test-an index applied to household incomes, divided and weighted by the equivalence scale-and a (new) sequential index test-an index applied to household incomes of the most needy only, the most and second most needy only, and so on. We illustrate the power of our test to detect welfare changes in Russia using data of the RLMS-surveys.","Although Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas, its ability to maintain timely and reliable supply to meet the growing global demand has come under question in recent months. The gas war with Ukraine notwithstanding, concern has been raised by a number of observers that underinvestment in the gas sector will lead to a systemic failure of the state monopolist OAO Gazprom to increase or even maintain current levels of production. Yet with a quarter of European gas coming from Russia, and with increasing presence of Gazprom in European downstream operations (such as Germany, Hungary, and other CIS states) as well as seemingly closer ties with Algeria, another major supplier of gas to Europe, there has been a strong reaction from Europe's policy-makers to decrease dependence on Russian gas.","In this article, the author discusses the recent experiences of cooperation between the Ministry of Justice of Finland and the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation and the Federal Registry Service regarding the development of a free state legal aid system in Russia. These experiences stem from a pilot project initiated and implemented by the Ministry of justice in the Russian Federation and associated with the Ministry of justice of Finland during 2006-2007.","This article explores the discourse of the Russian elite on foreign policy in general and on the European Union in particular, and identifies the main reasons for Russia's resistance to Europeanisation. At a theoretical level, the article builds upon the study of discourse conceived in 'structural' terms, and argues that discursive incompatibility at a deeper discursive level prevents the socialisation of elite members to attitudes more sympathetic to Europe at a more superficial level. Methodologically, the research is based on content analysis of major Russian foreign policy documents, presidential speeches and, in particular, of a set of interviews with Russian foreign policy-makers and academics most frequently in touch with the European Union.","The experience of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan (1979-1989) is considered through the prism of institutional transfers. Afghanistan has a long history of attempts to implement Muslim, Soviet and Anglo-Saxon institutional designs. Most of them have failed. This failure can be attributed to the lack of elective affinity' between traditional and new institutions imported from more developed countries. It is argued that a careful examination of the degree of elective affinity must precede any attempt of institutional transfers. An analysis of Ph.D. dissertations defended by Afghan students at Soviet and Russian universities complements logical arguments and references to historical facts.","Previous analysis of legislative voting has focused on the behavior of nominal legislative parties, regardless of whether the country under examination was an established democracy or a newly democratized country. This approach is inadequate for countries with Young party systems. To establish the extent to which legislative coalitions are party based, scholars must allow for the possibility that institutional incentives predominate over party influence. For this study, I applied a Bayesian discrete latent variable method to identify the legislative coalitions in the 1996-99 Duma. I found that legislative alignments cut across party lines: electoral incentives and support for the president contribute to divides within parties that lack coherent platforms. Here I present a novel methodological approach to the identification of intraparty divisions and the major determinants of legislative coalitions in many legislative settings. This approach allows a comparison of the importance of party influence relative to other institutional incentives. It is especially useful for analyzing legislative voting in young party systems and where constitutional frameworks and electoral systems subject legislators to competing pressures.","During the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in Soviet Russia. between 192 1 and 1928, the Bolshevik youth policy was highly ambivalent. of the one hand, the regime tried to suspend the militant, iconoclastic, cultural and revolutionary activism of the Civil War period: on the Other hand, it sought to bring tip children and adolescents with,I revolutionary consciousness. It was a revolution of the mind that the Bolshevik culture designers envisaged when they contemplated shaping a 'future race' and the new socialist person. In order to achieve this, nothing less than a 'cultural revolution' was Called for in 1925 by Nikolai Bukharin in the Komsomol press during the debate on youth morals. According to him, it was meant to lead to a 'fundamental change (perevorot) in the virtues of men, in their habits, in their feeling and desires ill the way they lived their daily life, in their byt (everyday life)-such a fundamental change that will make them into new men I. I Indeed. ill 1923 and 1928 Bukharin's focus was laid firmly on 'cadres' and ideology as the principal levers to be employed in achieving social change. 2 However, the complex and holistic plan for a cultural transformation of society he outlined in 192 Contrasted with the Bolshevik usage of the term in the 1920S when the cultural revolution was primarily understood as class war. The latter notion also became dominant in historical analysis after the publication In 1974 Of Fitzpatrick's intriguing article 'Cultural revolution in Russia 1928-1932'.(3) What is more, however, Fitzpatrick's studies created something of a historical paradigin that bound the term closely to the years 1928 to 1931/2.","In Russian Central Asia, \"reforms\" was the key word used by colonial officers and administrators when they drew up regulations to make the exercise of Islamic (shar'at) and customary (Vat) law more efficient and see to it that the legal practice of local communities complied with Imperial standards. Recent scholarship has not disregarded the importance of these issues, but attention has focused on colonial regulations while the legal features and the limits of the \"reforming\" policy on the Central Asian judicature have gone largely unquestioned. This paper argues that the Russians succeeded in reforming only the office of judge of shar'at- and Vat-based courts. In fact, by introducing elections for judgeships, the Empire subverted a long-standing practice: in precolonial Central Asia, appointments of qadis and biys came from the state, and various economic privileges came with the office. Focusing on Tashkent between 1876 and 1883, this study compares turnover among shar'at- and Vat-based judiciary, showing how elections brought about substantial instability only among the biys, while they did not undermine the stability of the qadis' position. The lack of stability among the biys cannot be ascribed to their inability to judge according to customary law, as has often been stated elsewhere, but rather to emerging competition over resources: a person who held the position of biy in Tashkent earned income both from his activity as judge and from serving as tax collector, while the qadis could not charge fees except when stipulating marriage contracts.","Two decades have passed since Joseph Brodsky used his Nobel address to advance the idea that \"aesthetics is the mother of ethics.\"Yet despite the increasing prominence of ethics in literary studies during this time, very little has been written to elucidate his claim. One thing the \"turn to ethics\" in literary studies has produced is a rise in popularity of Emmanuel Levinas among critics. The invocation of Levinasian responsibility, with its refusal to entertain a practical or normative ethics, demonstrates, among other things, how far some streams of ethical criticism have traveled from the politically inflected theory of earlier decades. In this article I place Levinas's writings alongside the critical prose of Brodsky, whose radical commitment to poetry - what Seamus Heaney called his \"peremptory trust in words\"- is set at a similar theoretical distance from the idea that the didactic, the deontological, or the political may be constitutive of ethics. To admit from the outset that Brodsky's maxim is inimical to Levinas's project - which is to establish ethics as the mother of philosophy, as it were - is to acknowledge that the rapprochement intended here cannot be in any sense final. Instead, in collocating Levinasian reflection on encounter, the originary, and the face-a-face with Brodsky's writings on poetry, I want to give philosophical substance to Brodsky's musings on the ethics of aesthetic encounter while simultaneously demonstrating one way Levinas can inform literary criticism.","Departing from the familiar scholarly focus on the ideological content of works by intelligentsia forerunners, this article examines the record of everyday life in their private and public writing. Konstantine Klioutchkine argues that their obsessive focus on ordinary experience indicated that articulating mundane desires was as important to the two writers as expressing progressive views. As professional journalists, Nikolai Chernyshevskii and Nikolai Dobroliubov organized their experience primarily by way of writing. Accordingly, the article explores rhetorical procedures accommodating both ideology and desire in their influential account of themselves as prototypical new men.","This essay investigates Russian government policies toward the press, in particular newspapers, during the constitutional period (1906-1917). It shows that despite relatively systematic judicial and administrative repression, which shut down the revolutionary press after the Revolution of 1905, a broad political spectrum of newspapers continued to appear throughout the period, including during the World War. In fact, the popular mass press helped to undermine the legitimacy of the government and the ruling dynasty on the eve of the Revolution of 1917.","In which the author turns first to a parable about a group of nineteenth-century radical Russian artists and then to her own experience, outside of academe and in, to respond to Aaron Sachs, 'Letters to a tenured historian'.","The article addresses a long-standing problem of the history of Russian: the origin of v in place of the etymological g in the Gen. sg. masc./neut. ending of adjectives and non-personal pronouns. This change is treated as conflation of inflectional and derivational morphology through analogy. The analogical substitution first occurred within multi-item personal names where non-Christian (byname) patronymics were used alongside Christian (baptismal) ones. Besides their etymological and morphological differences (quantitative vs. possessive adjectives respectively), the two types of patronymics differed syntactically. Christian patronymics were coordinated with the first name, while non-Christian patronymics were subordinated to the Christian ones as apposition in the Gen. case. If, in addition to the name bearer's own patronymic/s, his father's patronymic was used to identify him more precisely, it too would be in the Gen. Written records reveal that the cases of the patronymics were frequently confused, and both types eventually became coordinated with the first name. This triggered an abductive innovation, whereby the derivational morpheme-the possessive adjective-forming suffix -ov- -of one type of patronymics contaminated the Gen. ending -ogo, as well as the Nom. -oj in another type. The formant -ov- became the morphological marker of a Russian surname, while the new Gen. ending spread to regular adjectives.","For many centuries the attitude towards baptised Jews within Jewish society was extremely negative, as baptism was perceived as apostasy. This attitude persists to this day, even though many Jews have abandoned Judaism and a secular Jewish identity has emerged. After seven decades of Soviet rule, during which a new Soviet, wholly secular Jewish identity, was constructed, Jewish identity in the former Soviet Union (FSU) is based mainly on the ethnic principle. As a result of an almost total detachment from Judaism, some Soviet and former-Soviet Jews have converted to Russian Orthodoxy. Moreover, we can see the formation of a paradoxical Russian Orthodox Jewish self-identification in post-Soviet Russia. This processes, its trends and peculiar features are poorly studied, a matter this paper intends to remedy.","The purpose of this article is to study the use of oUP-DOWNo metaphors in Russian and French material. A list of 10 conceptual metaphors expressing up-down movement was proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980), and this list has been reproduced many times since. However, this analysis shows that the list is not fully accurate. In addition to the conceptual metaphors proposed by Lakoff and Johnson, the authors find it important to include 5 more metaphorical models expressing vertical movement. On the other hand, 5 of the conceptual metaphors in Lakoff and Johnson's list turned out not to be relevant to this analysis. The authors also attempt to describe the connections between different metaphoric models and observe that not all metaphoric models are equally important in their evidential and conceptual power.","Persons with serious and disabling medical conditions have traveled abroad in search of stem cell treatments in recent years. However, weak or nonexistent oversight systems in some countries provide insufficient patient protections against unproven stem cell treatments, raising concerns about exposure to harm and exploitation. The present article, the first of two, describes and analyzes stem cell tourism in Russia and India and addresses several scientific/medical, ethical, and policy issues raised by the provision of unproven stem cell-based treatments within them. The distinction between treatment based on proven clinical research and \"innovative treatment\" is addressed and the authors conclude that the innovations at issue constitute neither. Regulatory measures need to be developed or strengthened in accord with internationally accepted standards in such countries to protect those seeking stem cell treatments.","The present paper is an attempt to elucidate some aspects of the social and legal status of slaves and, generally, the dependent populace in the North-Eastern Cauca-Caucasus. The material introduced here allows to reveal some characteristic features of sus. slavery and servitude, as well as several forms of deprivation of rights and social harrasment of the people belonging to lower classes in the mentioned area during the late mediaeval period.","A noted British specialist in Russia's economic geography and the Far East region presents a comprehensive account of the development of the onshore and offshore oil and gas deposits of Sakhalin. Following a review of early multinational activity in geological surveying and exploration during the 1970s, he charts subsequent changes in the entities formed to develop and exploit the deposits (Sakhalin-I and -II) later in the Soviet period and during the first two decades of Russian independence. These changes have responded to improved knowledge of the geology of the deposits and changing relations between the Russian central government and Sakhalin regional authorities. Also analyzed are efforts by the Russian side to overturn or otherwise modify terms of previous agreements deemed unfavorable, and maneuvering by China and Japan to secure increasing sources of supply for their markets. With Sakhalin's two core projects now entering the active production phase, the author distills a number of key issues that have shaped the development of the island's offshore hydrocarbon resources and will have a bearing on prospects for a future generation of less spectacular new projects (incremental development); he also outlines wider lessons that have been learned over the life of Sakhalin's projects.

To many, it conjures images of the Industrial Revolution, steam ships, steam trains, appalling working conditions and loss of life in the mines, thick air and gritty eyes and noses in the western metropolises. In the Baltic Region, the use of coal is declining everywhere but Russia. These generally mature economies are successfully shifting to cleaner fuels. However, as much of the South China Sea region is in the midst of economic take-off and modernization, coal consumption is on the rise. The demand for electric power is soaring and coal seems to be the only way to produce the vast amounts of electricity required. This paper examines the production of coal within the South China Sea region and the shared need to attempt to minimise the carbon emissions resulting from the use of so much coal.","What were the causes and consequences of the revolutions of 1989 in Eastern and Central Europe? The causes lie in the exhaustion of the model of Soviet-type economic organization, the failure of reform efforts in the USSR, and the persistence of opposition to Soviet-type rule in Central Europe. The ramifications of the events are examined through the prism of three questions: (1) how do they change our evaluation of the past?; (2) what was the significance of 1989 as a moment in time?; and (3) how have they shaped the present?.","Missile defenses have been a source of contention in US-Russian relations since the beginning of the strategic dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union. Almost every nuclear arms reduction treaty has involved tough negotiations over the extent to which missile defenses would be permitted for each side and this year, the New START treaty ratification process made clear that missile defenses will remain a primary source of contention during future rounds of disarmament negotiations. The US Congress is not willing to accept constraints on missile defense capabilities and the Russians do not want any significant increase in US strategic missile defense capacity. The issue seems zero-sum, but there is a way to move beyond these positions-a way that has been much discussed but, so far, little pursued.","The starting point of this paper is recognition that the depiction of a formal/informal labour dualism, which views formal and informal labour as separate and hostile realms, is inappropriate for capturing the range of labour practices in societies. This is because labour practices cannot be neatly separated into discrete formal and informal realms, the differences within the formal and informal spheres are as great as the differences between the two realms, and formal and informal labour are not always embedded in different economic relations, values and motives. Here, an alternative more nuanced conceptual lens is proposed that resolves these problems and in so doing captures the multifarious labour practices in societies, namely the total social organization of labour (TSOL) perspective. This depicts labour practices as existing along a spectrum from more formal-oriented to more informal-oriented practices and cross-cuts this with a further spectrum from non-monetized, through in-kind and reciprocal labour, to monetized labour. Applying this conceptual lens, the results of a survey of the anatomy of labour practices in an affluent, mixed and deprived district of Moscow, comprising 313 face-to-face interviews, are then analysed. This reveals that socio-spatial variations in the organisation of labour are not solely about the degree of formalization of working life. Instead, this study unravels that populations range from relatively affluent 'work busy' populations undertaking, and voluntarily selecting from, a multiplicity of labour practices, to relatively disadvantaged 'work deprived' populations engaged in a narrower range of practices and more commonly out of necessity and in the absence of alternatives. The outcome is call for both the wider application and refinement of this TSOL approach when mapping the social organisation of labour and evaluations of whether the finding from Moscow are more widely valid in other societal contexts.","Kaspe studies the \"Aesopian language\" expressed in the science fiction universe of the Strugatsky brothers' works and shows how the dual need to search for hidden meanings and screen out \"noise\" aimed at the censors influenced readers' interpretations of everyday life.","In this article, Jenifer Presto argues that the 1908 Messina-Reggio Calabria earthquake had an impact on Aleksandr Blok no less significant than that which the 1755 Lisbon earthquake had on writers of the Enlightenment and proceeds to demonstrate how it shaped Blok's aesthetics of catastrophe. This aesthetics can best be termed the \"decadent sublime,\" an inversion of the Kantian dynamic sublime with its emphasis on bourgeois optimism. Following Immanuel Kant, Blok acknowledges the fear and attraction that nature's forces can inspire; however, unlike Kant, he insists that modern man remains powerless in the face of nature, owing to his decadence a decadence endemic to European civilization. The decadent sublime is manifested in a host of Blok's writings, ranging from \"The Elements and Culture\" to Lightning Flashes of Art and The Soythians; it is intensely visual and is indebted to images of ruin by artists such as Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Luca Signorelli.","The purpose of this article is to determine whether a 'dark side' exists to Russia's trust-building in the Black Sea region. An empirical analysis is made of whether, and how, Russia uses soft power to deter democratization by anchoring the promotion of pro-Russian separatism in Crimea to the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It is argued that despite the unavoidable methodological challenges the topic brings with it, one cannot ignore it even in academic research because of its constantly growing empirical importance. A presentation is made of some of the actors and activities that built trust between the Crimean population and Russia by affecting Ukraine's soft power security. The legitimacy of such activities and the extent to which they may be linked to the post-Soviet political-criminal nexus are also considered.","Household formation patterns have been adduced in recent years by historians and other social scientists to account for the economic development of western Europe. The so-called European Marriage Pattern, which prevailed throughout northwest Europe, is viewed as having been particularly conducive to early industrialisation and economic growth. But to what extent were household formation systems exogenous to the broader economic and social context in which they were located? Evidence from nineteenth-century Russia indicates that family systems were influenced by the same variables that determined the shape of the local economy; they were part of a complex web of institutions and thus cannot be viewed as independent determinants of economic development.

Previously all decrees (ukazy), and indeed almost all legislative texts apart from the 1649 law code (Ulozhenie) of Aleksei Mikhailovich, had been issued in manuscript and disseminated through hand-written copies and oral proclamation. Peter's decree on the use of print was a landmark in the administrative uses of printing in Russia. It was intended as such by Peter, and perceived as such by his successors. The continued success of this initiative is contrasted with the repeated failure of other projects for the systematic use of printing in legislation: the attempts to produce a new systematic code, and to publish regular chronological compilations of laws. This article considers the context, implications, and consequences of Peter's innovative ruling. The main questions under consideration are: why had printing not been used for these purposes earlier? what specific functions was the technology called upon to fulfil? and what were its relations with other technologies? Particular attention is paid to the perceived and actual roles of printing as an aid to (i) distribution, (ii) standardization, and (iii) the emblematic projection of authority. In each case, printing is considered not in isolation, but in its relations with the uses of manuscript and speech. A final section considers some ways in which Peter's instruction was followed or adapted by his 18th-century successors.","Russia's most recent energy initiatives, the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic and the South Stream pipeline across the Black Sea, have prompted a great deal of questions as to the economic viability of the two ventures and the real intentions behind them. The European Union's difficulties in bringing to life its Nabucco project, which has been in the works since 2002, shows how difficult building a pipeline several thousands of miles long can be without centralized state support. Even while the international legal regime for overland and underwater pipelines covers much ground, the complexities and spy-novel-like intrigues surrounding the implementation of Europe's rival pipeline systems cannot be adequately accounted for under the existing framework. The objective of this article is to analyse the different political and legal controversies surrounding the construction of gas pipelines in Europe.","What is the essential validity of Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky's work for contemporary cinema? It is the fact that the symptoms of the moral disease of our civilization denounced by Tarkovsky have intensified rather than reduced as the years have passed. Tarkovsky's heroes are the poor and the sick, children and mad people: spiritual orphans who carry the signs of martyrdom. Yet their very fragility becomes the source of their salvation as they seek spiritual fullness through the abolition of history. For contemporary man has become dispossessed of tradition, a situation that has been characterized by Walter Benjamin, and latterly by Giorgio Agamben, using images from the art of, respectively, Paul Klee and Albrecht Durer. In contemporary culture there is a contradiction between art and history, and this contradiction is the essential theme of Tarkovsky's work.","When discussing case variation in Modern Russian predicate adjectives, scholars usually rely on data found in affirmative contexts. However, an examination of predicate adjectives in negative alongside affirmative contexts reveals important statistical differences and usage asymmetries that help understand the factors involved in case choice. The fact that case choices are differently distributed under negation has been noted by scholars, who traditionally argue that negation favors the instrumental. Examining statistical data gathered from the open web, this article updates the existing literature by showing that while the instrumental is more prominent with inanimate referents, the short nominative is significantly more prominent with animate referents. Additional usage asymmetries, such as the scarcity of the long nominative under negation, are also uncovered. Adopting the functionalist/construction-grammar perspective, I will discuss the statistical results to show how case choice is influenced by animacy-related factors such as agentive control and narrative interaction, and how specific predicate adjective constructions are adopted for structuring viewpoint.","The article discusses Nikolai Berdyaev's conception of values: the origin, hierarchic order, cognitional situation, and possibility of realization on a cultural plane. The philosopher dwells on the above issues by considering the topics of personal self-development, as well as the cultural development of the nation and of mankind. Berdyaev presents freedom and love as qualities of human spiritual nature. All human beings face the ontological task to recognize these qualities inside themselves and then to build their individual being on that foundation. Historically determined values as well as their interplay are formed and set by the human being himself (historical mankind). The society's orientation towards natural spiritual values determines good national cultural development as well as purposeful historical process. Berdyaev employs the sobornost principle to deal with a society's or a person's inner axiological confusion.","This paper tests for price convergence in Russian energy markets from January 2003 to October 2010. Monthly energy prices for four energy products (diesel, gasoline, electricity and coal) for 83 Russian regions are drawn from Russia's statistical agency Rosstat The study contributes to the existing literature by using the Exponential Smooth Auto-Regressive Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test in a panel setup, which encompasses cross-section dependence. We find that there are no fully integrated national energy markets in Russia. possibly due to the peripheral position of diverging regions, unbalanced distribution of energy reserves and limited cross-border transmission capacity.

The aim of this article is to link the two phenomena: does Global Zero require effective missile defence, or will missile defence hamper the road towards nuclear elimination? First, I will examine how proponents of the recent move towards nuclear elimination regard missile defence: are they in favour or against? This descriptive portion of the article is followed by a personal evaluation based on the literature. Assuming that nuclear elimination becomes a priority in order to win the fight against nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, and assuming that missile defence will not become reliable under real circumstances, then the best option seems to be zero offensive and zero defensive ballistic missiles. Second best would be to limit the existing missile defence capabilities to theatre missile defence, excluding those theatre missile defence systems (like advanced SM-3 missiles on Aegis ships) that can easily be plugged together to form a strategic missile defence capability.","This study is to analyze why Russia continuously tries to construct the trans-Korean gas pipeline, despite the possibility of the North Korean risk and the limited economic benefit it offers compared to China's pipeline. As the world's number-one gas producer, Russia exports gas abroad through gas pipelines. As a result, Russia holds a wealth of expertise and experience related to gas pipelines. In particular, the crucial cases of gas pipeline disputes related to Russia since the collapse of the former Soviet Union mainly occurred during the Putin regime; the current President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is trying to complete the trans-Korean gas pipeline. The content of the study is based on the above common ground. First, as Russia exports gas to various states through the gas pipelines, a great influence from its foreign policy standpoint is inevitable. Thus, this study will explore Putin's foreign policy of pragmatic realism. Second, the cause and effect of gas pipeline disputes concerning Russia during Putin's presidential term will be scrutinized with focus on Putin's pragmatic realism. Third, this paper will review the correlation between the results of cases of the gas pipeline dispute in relation to Russia and the gas market expansion in Russia's Northeast Asia. Lastly, this study will conceptualize the reasons for why Russia wishes to complete the trans-Korean gas pipeline based on these analyses.","The \"newness\" in Russia's current protest movement has more to do with the creation of new ties and relationships among existing protest groups, which increases the mobilizational power of their argument, than in the recruitment of new activists and participants.","Pelevin's novel T and prose collection Pineapple Water for the Beautiful Lady (Ananasnaia voda dlia prekrasnoi damy) explore the (post) modern notion of fallible authorship. Foucault's formulation of the author function as an interpretative construct implies the author figure as both cause and effect, arising from the text and imposed upon it. In T Pelevin posits the character and reader as co-creators of the text, existing with the author in an endless and solipsistic creative loop without origin. In Ananasnaia voda Pelevin attempts to look outside this 'vicious circle' towards a Creator, a point of narrative origin.","Across several countries, science is often regarded as unpopular and a male-dominated domain. Furthermore, the number of students who are interested in science education or intend to work in the field of science is relatively low. This might be due to expectations adolescents hold towards science and successful scientists. The current cross-national study investigates the expectations of students in relation to highly achieving peers in science education in the three countries China, Germany and Russia (N=420). Students were asked to indicate their expectations about two fictitious new classmates with respect to three categories: intelligence, social competence and eagerness. Besides national differences, differences concerning the gender of the participating students, the gender of the target students (fictitious highly achieving students in science education) and interaction effects were investigated. Whereas the effects of gender and target gender are inconsistent and negligible, there are significant national differences. Notably, Chinese students hold the most positive expectations about successful peers in science education. The results are discussed with regard to possible explanations and educational consequences.","Dmitriev's paper revisits and reconsiders university tradition in Soviet and post-Soviet era as it is reflected in Russian narratives about university. The official discourse of the period of 1920s-1930s was characterized by the emphasis on the idea of revolutionary rupture with the old [imperial] university tradition. In contrast, from mid-1930s and later, still during Stalin's lifetime, the emphasis shifted to the discussions of the struggle of 'progressive professorship' for the advanced ideals and Russian science. Then, in 1960s-1980s the idea overcame of direct succession between Soviet and pre-Revolutionary university. After 1991 the idea of 'classic university' became the most important administrative concept and the rationale for privileges legitimization. The prominence of this notion is motivated by the desire to preserve the academic hierarchy and the intrinsic structure of the university of the Brezhnev era.","Although Japan and Russia have economic and security incentives to agree to a compromise settling the sixty-nine-year-old Northern Territories dispute, domestic political concerns pertaining to nationalism remain the key impediment to resolution.","From the second half of 19th to early 20th century, due to the distribution of the renovationist ideology of Jadidism, the life of Russian Muslims underwent profound changes. In the case of Tatars, these changes, among other things, came through the discovery of the childhood culture, reforming Tatar schools and textbooks. The new primers (alphabet books) based on a more advanced phonetic method of teaching, taught Tatar instead of Arabic or Turki, included secular texts and were often illustrated. They substituted the former religious primers which utilized the letter-by-letter reading principle. This article follows the process of creation and adoption of new Tatar primers in the educational space of the Kazan governorate and other regions of Russia at the turn of the 20th century. In this paper, we aim to reveal the background, main features and the outcomes of this process.","Russians currently form the largest foreign tourist group visiting Finland. Market studies show that most of the money spent by Russian tourists during their visits is allocated towards food. However, their perceptions of food and food-related preferences during their visits have not been studied in detail. This study focuses on understanding the perceptions, experiences and awareness of Russian tourists concerning local food in the South Savo region. It applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to reach a more in-depth understanding of Russian tourists' relations to local food. The results show that Russian tourists especially value the freshness and healthiness associated with local food. Nevertheless, the motivators to use local food products appear to be different when it comes to food products in Finland or in Russia. In addition, local food products are poorly recognised, and tourists are not familiar with local South Savo food. Consequently, the study reveals potential factors that could increase the Russian tourists' usage of local food products or food services while visiting the region and potentially other tourist destinations.

Drawing upon ethnographic research in two border towns at the Russian-Estonian border, the article makes a case for a grounded examination of these border dynamics that takes into account how borders as sites of 'mobility and enclosure' are negotiated in everyday life and shaped by the differentiated incorporations of statecraft into people's lives. Depending on their historical memories, people interpret the border either as a barrier to previously free movement or as a security device and engage in correspondingly different relations to the state-privileging local concerns for mobility or adopting the state's concerns over security and sovereignty. Analysing these border negotiations and the relations between citizens and the state, articulated in people's expectations and claims, can provide us with a better understanding of how people participate in the making of borders and contribute to the stability and malleability of political orders.","This article scrutinises attempts by the British Foreign and Colonial Office to control information in its colonies between 1946 and 1950. Several factors combined to alter the ground on which colonial officials operated in this period: an emerging 'Cold War' between Britain and its wartime Soviet ally, international debates about creating an enforceable catalogue of 'human rights' and a heightened emphasis on public relations within British colonies as a strategy for imperial governance. These factors converged in the response of colonial officials to the writing of one of the most notorious anti-colonial activists in Britain at the time, George Padmore. By analysing British Colonial Office reports of Soviet propaganda in their colonies, the article suggests new analysis about some of the ways in which the rhetoric of the Cold War impacted on Britain's approach to empire after the Second World War.","Over the last decade, the Russian education system has undergone significant transformation that has radically changed the expectations placed upon the school principals. This current reform process has placed far greater responsibilities and accountabilities upon principals to secure school effectiveness and improved student learning outcomes. This article offers some insights into the way in which principals in Russia are currently prepared and trained. It outlines initial quantitative findings from Russian principals, as part of a contemporary, large-scale empirical study of principal leadership preparation and training. The emerging empirical evidence highlights that the new principal standards and training requirements in Russia reinforce managerial approaches that are not necessarily meeting the needs of principals.","Islamic finance signifies more than a projection of religious affiliation. The importance of Islamic finance is increasing in central Asia, both as a source of capital and as a form of post-colonial market-building. In central Asia, it is an important facet of the new phenomena of nation-branding' and a means of reinvigorating the economy. In identity politics, Islamic finance projects an attitude of religious tolerance allowing states in the region to reposition their geopolitical identity relative to the Islamic community. This creates a performance' of Islamic finance that facilitates the creation of legitimacy for the state. Adopting Islamic finance projects images of the state's religious tolerance and diversity without changing the underlying structures; it suggests an Islamicness' that is useful to the development and post-colonial goals of the state. As such, it creates opportunities for geopolitical alliances with Muslim countries. Economically, it appeals to rising financial-industrial elites seeking new investment-opportunities, which reduces pressure on the state to democratize. Meanwhile, in Russia, Islamic finance is an alternative source of capital for the sanctions-hit state and a useful identity marker with which to connect to the increasingly wary Caucuses and Commonwealth of Independent States countries, lending it a wider significance across Eurasia.","Variability in men's reproductive success (RS) is partly attributable to the ability of successful men to influence resource flows relevant to the mate choice and reproduction of women. This study explores the effects of variability in resource flows on men's RS in an indigenous foraging/ mixed-economy community in northern Siberia where monogamous marriage norms predominate. A series of material, embodied, and relational wealth indicators are tested as predictors of men's age-adjusted RS and age at first birth. Material wealth related to hunting, embodied wealth as represented by hunting skill, and relational wealth as represented by numbers of kin are the most consistent predictors of men's RS. In this monogamous population, the wives of men with more hunting capital and of men rated as better hunters have shorter interbirth intervals, and hunters show strong producer priority. These findings and ethnographic observations appear more consistent with a provisioning model than with a signaling-formates model.","The present paper explores the hitherto unknown beginnings of the Ottoman-Russian imperial rivalry by focusing on the mid-16th-century encounter between the Ottoman Empire and the Tsardom of Muscovy over the North Caucasus, where the ambitions of these two asymmetric powers the Ottomans being an established \"super power\" and the Muscovites a rising power became entangled for the first time. This first encounter, which was the harbinger of many future engagements not only in this region but also in the broader steppe frontier around the Black Sea, was more of a \"cold war\" rather than a military confrontation, as both the Ottomans and the Muscovites rather preferred to establish spheres of influence and eventually their hegemony over the North Caucasus through their vassals and clients. In addition to demonstrating the Tsardom of Muscovy's initial claims and policies over the North Caucasus, this study will shed light on the reasons of the Ottoman failure to transform their nominal claims over the region to a de facto hegemony similar to what they had established over Eastern European principalities.","This study examines the nature of relationships between customer perceptions of frontline employee service delivery (core and relational), satisfaction and selected behavioural intentions by using customers of a commercial retail bank in Russia as its setting. Contrary to findings from North American-Western research, the study findings show that relational service delivery only significantly impacts customer satisfaction for Russian males whereas core service delivery only impacts this affective outcome for Russian female customers. Implications of the results are discussed and future research avenues are offered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of our study is to develop and validate instruments that can be used to compare student skill gains in mathematics and physics courses in undergraduate engineering programmes across countries. The approach includes procedures to establish construct validity and other necessary psychometric properties. Drawing on data collected from over 24 engineering experts and 3600 engineering students across Russia and China, we establish that it is possible to develop valid, equitable and cross-nationally comparable instruments that can assess and compare skill gains.","This article proposes a new approach to understanding Russian pro-regime counter-demonstrations, arguing that starting from 2014, they have acquired a distinctively demobilizational outlook: whereas the opposition seeks to mobilize the population to action, what suits the regime best is a safely de-mobilized majority. This interpretation requires a perspective different from that used for studying opposition demonstrations: instead of seeing the regime's social media strategy for promoting counter-demonstrations as attempts to attract maximum involvement, the message should be judged on its capacity to discourage large-scale collective action. To show how this works in practice, the two biggest recent pro-regime counter-demonstrations are analysed: their context and background and the promotion of them on their official VKontakte pages and in related Twitter posts by prominent pro-regime tweeters. What may appear as strategies to mobilize for counter-demonstrations emerge as efforts to engender emotions that serve the regime's purpose of keeping the population apolitical and passive.","This article proposes a comparative, cross-border analysis of the sources of rural combustibility around the complex frontier between Austria-Hungary, Tsarist Russia and the states that emerged out of the fringes of the Ottoman Empire, Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria, at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Starting from the major peasant uprising that took place in 1907 in Romania, the article seeks to account for the fledgling country's explosiveness in contrast to its neighbours, given the structural and functional similarities of the systems around the frontier. It argues that, despite these skin-deep similarities, there were vital differences as regards the initial terms of peasant emancipation and the presence of a system of checks and balances, which could curb the impositions of the great landowners onto the peasants.","This paper investigates the problem of trust and solidarity as they were mirrored in private manuscripts on cooking and housekeeping, and traces the circulation of culinary information within specific social networks. Soviet handwritten cookbooks, though rooted in the nineteenth-century tradition, constituted a phenomenon in and of themselves. They maintained and transmitted everyday knowledge on cooking, which was perceived as being opposed to state-published cooking books and brochures. Gastronomical models represented by The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food and other culinary writings were beyond reach of an average Soviet citizen. On the one hand, this inaccessibility aroused huge scepticism; on the other hand, it invigorated invisible cuisine an informal exchange of routine culinary skills that had aimed to accommodate official quasi-reality to the Soviet everyday life, and to reconcile a dream with a real food basket. Up until perestroika, private cookbooks functioned not only as a corpus of personal skills that could both compensate flaws of economics of shortage and control everyday life, but also an important tool of gender socialisation that could be used to support social prestige, create solidarity and reinforce social bonds.","This article empirically studies the impact of bilingualism on educational achievements. This relationship has been thoroughly studied in a number of countries around the world, but not in Russia. We used a sample of 709 ethnic Tatar school students aged 15-16 (in the ninth grade) in the spring of the year 2010. We found a positive significant effect on school grades based on logistic regressions, and controlling for family background characteristics, school characteristics, psychological attributes, health issues, peers, gender, and the impact of the capital city Kazan. Oral bilingual children, who use Tatar language at home, are more likely to obtain the highest grades in literature and chemistry classes, and they have lower probabilities of obtaining the lowest grades in Russian language, literature, geometry, and physics. We did not find negative impacts on school grades due to the use of Tatar at home. Therefore, we found evidence in favour of bilingualism and against the assumption of Russian policymakers that bilingualism threatens the knowledge of Russian.","In this article, I delve into the multifaceted roles and remarkable significance of the Bulgarian left in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and the tumultuous period that followed. In particular, I look at the special relationship' of the Bulgarian and Russian left and the concrete ways in which people, materials, and ideas were exchanged via various channels, in particular across the Black Sea. The loyalties, ties, and contributions of the Bulgarian left to the Russian (and global) revolutionary project were considerable and in many respects out of proportion to Bulgaria's size and international significance. Here I offer a window onto the different ways in which Bulgarians participated in and read the revolution through their own lens, but also reveal the story of the importance of the Bulgarian or, perhaps more accurately, Balkan factor in the series of events in which the Bolsheviks established, consolidated, and spread their power.","The article examines narrative strategies in recollections related to the resettlement of the Nenets from Novaia Zemlia during the 1950s. The material consists of interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, newspaper articles, literature on the history of Novaia Zemlia, and an Internet discussion forum. The strategies are analyzed to be borne at the intersection of public and private discourses and varying relations to the so-called authorized discourse and the nuclear uncanny that those recollecting use and recreate in their reminiscences. The nuclear uncanny and the authorized discourse are used to separate the narrated event (the past) from the contemporary narrative event and to create connections between them.","In his reaction to Mark Lipovetsky's essay, Vladislav Zubok suggests that the Soviet intelligentsia was not a second version of the prerevolutionary one and warns against treating the Soviet educated classes epiphenomenally. Similarly, post-Soviet Russian intellectuals differ drastically in their environment from Soviet ones. Zubok also argues that the \"binary concepts\" and \"essentialist thinking\" of the Soviet intelligentsia criticized by Lipovetsky are part of any politics, and conceptual vehicles such as class, gender, or nation are important for political mobilization. Zubok also wonders about the lack of patriotism among contemporary Russian liberals and connects the absence of political nationalism or patriotism among the intelligentsia to the specific conditions of the post-Stalin USSR. For Zubok, even the political nation of \"rossiiane\" requires a culture of affection. He contends that the historical lesson for the Russian intelligentsia lies in its inability to bridge the gap to the millions of supporters of Vladimir Putin. Finally, Zubok argues that although the Soviet intelligentsia did not generate its own postructuralism or participate in the Western strand of it, this did not present a uniform phenomenon. Zubok describes the diversity of this intelligentsia as underwritten by the \"universalist humanism\" of the Russian tradition, from the religious-philosophical writers of the Silver Age to the formalists. Finally, Zubok argues that Russian intellectuals cannot limit themselves to cultural politics if they desire political relevance.","War and revolution were so tightly intertwined in 1917 Russia that the question of continuing the war to victory or finding a way to a negotiated peace became the basis for fundamental political conflict. This caused a dramatic realignment of politics and parties and drove the revolution steadily leftward. The question of the war was central to the three big crises of the Provisional Government's period - the April Crisis, the July Crisis and the Kornilov Affair - as well as to the coming of the October Revolution. Despite their leadership of the soviets and effective control of the Provisional Government, the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary led Revolutionary Defencist bloc failed to solve the many problems facing Russia in the spring and summer of 1917. In no area, however, was the failure so disastrous as the failure to find some way to get Russia out of the war. The tragedy, perhaps pathos, of the Russian Revolution is that hope for a broad democratic outcome depended on a negotiated peace programme that, in the political and military conditions of Europe of 1917, had virtually no chance of success.","Despite the ever-growing number of studies about impersonal constructions, there is still no unanimity about which constructions actually fall under the label of impersonality. Consensus on how to define impersonals, even within one language, remains elusive in part because of the opposition between formal (subject-centred) and functional (agent-centred) approaches to impersonality, as outlined by Siewierska (2008). The paper attempts to combine both lines of reasoning. It suggests that the impersonal domain in Russian is represented by a network of constructions that are all related to one another by the formal marker of impersonality on the verb (i.e., third person singular neuter) and by semantic and pragmatic characteristics (namely, deviation from prototypical subject properties; Malchukov & Ogawa 2011).","The 1917 Revolution was the result of a paradigm shift from classical ontology, with its stability based on the dualism of nature and reason, object and subject, male and female, to a radical constructivism - that is, a rejection of previous foundations and the acceptance of the assumption that reality is variable, event-driven, and contingent, causing accepted oppositions to split apart and regroup in new configurations If classical binarism had gendered empirical foundations, the new construction had an explicit politics of re-describing gendered binarism I attempt to demonstrate that the performance of gender norms was a necessary result of this paradigmatic shift This shift was accompanied by a swell in the women's popular movement and the formation of women's parties, including both the feminist suffragettes and the Social Democrats before 1917.","When the Cold War was ended in 1989, Francis Fukuyama wrote, three years later, his very well-known book proposing a quite original thesis. He argues that the end of fascism and of communism means the triumph of Eastern liberalism in history. Following a Hegelian perspective, Fukuyama said contrary to Marx that communism, like the other previous economic-political systems that are not liberal, has been only a step to achieve a liberal society. So it happened in Russia and in Eastern Europe, and so it seems to be happening with the progressive opening of the market in China. Today, more than twenty years after Fukuyama wrote, it is time to ask whether secular liberal Western societies still appear to the eyes of humankind to provide the best option. In fact, with the economic crises in Europe, with the austerity imposed on many people and affecting deeply the lives of at least one generation, are liberal societies at risk? Does the growth of the Islamic state after the Arab Spring question the foundation of democratic principles? Considering also Russia and the geo-political problems in Ukraine, can we say that the East has become or is in the process of becoming really democratic? Is the growing popularity of political parties opposed to the European Union, and often embracing anti-democratic ideologies, compatible with Fukuyama's thesis? It is true, we must say that the American philosopher whom I mentioned assumed that, even if liberal economic-political systems were the best option, their triumph was not automatic and necessary in the long-term. However, Francis Fukuyama recently wrote a new book in which he analyzes a kind of contemporary democratic recession in the first decade of the twenty-first century, a recession that he sees as having delayed the democratic triumph all over the world and over history he announced in the nineties. For me, it is quite interesting to notice how Joseph Ratzinger shares, even if from a different perspective, the concerns of Fukuyama. The German theologian, who became the Pope during a time of political and economic crises, experienced the dictatorship of Nazism and was a protagonist of the Second Vatican Council, in which the Catholic Church accepted positively the principles of democratic society. While, in the past, the relationship between the Church and the \"so-called\" democrats was characterized especially by confrontation, it seems to me that today, Christianity encourages and is best able to preserve democratic principles. Furthermore, the originality of Ratzinger's theology consists not only in reconciling the main liberal democratic values with Catholic thought but especially in showing that the condition of the possibility of democracy resides in such Christian theology: democratic values are intelligible and grounded within such theology.","This article reviews the vast literature on Russia's transformation into a \"militocracy\"-a state in which individuals with career experience in Russia's various force structures occupy important positions throughout the polity and economy-during the reign of former KGB lieutenant colonel Vladimir Putin. We show that (1) elite militarization has been extensively utilized both to describe and explain core features of Russian foreign and domestic policy; and (2) notwithstanding its widespread usage, the militocracy framework rests on a rather thin, and in some cases flawed, body of empirical research. We close by discussing the remaining research agenda on this subject and listing several alternative theoretical frameworks to which journalists and policymakers arguably should pay equal or greater attention.","Soon after Debussy's death in March 2018, Stravinsky began work on a memorial, the Symphonies d'instruments a vent (1920). This piece was to become iconic both for music-theoretical reflection on modern approaches to musical time and for musicological archaeologies of Stravinsky's debts to Russian traditions'. Along both avenues, particular emphasis has long been given to the work's closing chorale, initially published separately in the 1920 Debussy tombeau issue of La Revue musicale.This article argues for a radical reappraisal of the Symphonies, which builds anew on Stephen Walsh's 1996 study of the sketches and shifts the emphasis onto temporal questions long neglected under pitch-focused analysis. Exposing thematic' concerns of rhythmic and metrical parsing (as distinct from unifying motives or pitch sets), and interpreting Stravinsky's hommage in light of Debussy's famous 1907 definition of music as de couleurs et de temps rythmes', I ultimately bring fresh metacritical perspective to fundamental questions of analytical method and purpose long entertained (e.g.) by Joseph Kerman, Carl Dahlhaus, Kofi Agawu, and Robert Walser.","It is widely alleged that President Putin's regime attempted to exercise influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It is known that its Soviet predecessors funded Western communist parties for decades as a means to undermine noncommunist regimes. Similarly, the United States has a long history of interfering in the institutions and elections of its Latin American neighbors, as well as (at the height of the Cold War) its European allies. More recently, many believe that, absent U.S.-driven assistance, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia would have lost the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election to Slobodan Miloevi. As those examples suggest, attempting to subvert the democratic elections of a putatively sovereign country is a time-honored way of bending the latter's domestic and foreign policy to one's will. In this paper, I focus on the state-sponsored, nonviolent, nonkinetic subversion of nationwide elections (for short, subversion) through campaign and party financing, tampering with electoral registers, and conducting disinformation campaigns about candidates. I argue that, under certain conditions and subject to certain constraints, subversion is pro tanto justified as a means to prevent or end large-scale human rights violations.","Socialist bloc exhibits in China in the 1950s communicated ideas about the future prosperity and development to be brought to China in the wake of its alliance with the socialist world, the role of socialism in preserving and maintaining folk and traditional culture, and the role of the bloc in extending the virtues of European high culture to the East. The Soviets proudly displayed Russia's historic contribution to high culture as well as information about contemporary events at the Bol'shoi Theater and other cultural institutions in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the East Germans and the Czechoslovaks similarly emphasized the prestige and quality of their past artists and composers as well as their contemporary symphonies and orchestras. The Chinese, however, were increasingly disappointed both with socialist bloc approaches to Chinese development as well as with depictions of Chinese culture that reminded them of the heritage of European imperialism. They complained in the exhibit comment books about methods, practices and technology that offered little to unique Chinese conditions and peculiarities. They were frustrated by the inefficiencies of Soviet-style socialism, and they even complained about the food at the Moscow Restaurant. By the end of the decade, the exhibits served as yet another example of the miscommunication, frustration and dispute over models of development that contributed to the Sino-Soviet split.","Over the past several decades, public relations scholarship has added significant richness to its understanding of dialogue. Such research has followed a theoretical trajectory centered on the \"I and Thou\" philosophy of Martin Buber. Drawing from Mikhail Bakhtin's Dialogic Imagination, this essay puts public relations dialogic scholarship into conversation with the concept of dialogue in a broader societal context. Bakhtin's work provides additional understanding of public relations' roles in dialogue, particularly in regards to facilitating public conversations. Bakhtin's emphasis on contextual and individually generated meanings illuminates the nature and structure of public conversations and the potential for public relations practitioners to play a more active and positive role in the enactment of open dialogue.","Erikh Soloviev, is one of the most distinguished representatives of the older generation of contemporary Russian philosophers. This article is an attempt to offer a survey of his philosophical ideas from the point of view of the communicative sociology of knowledge. The communicative form of sociology of knowledge is concerned with study of a variety of influences that specific persons and social groups have on the development of philosophical and cultural spheres of societal life.The author considers such areas of Soloviev's research as the Western existentialist philosophy and literature; investigation into intellectual life and social ideas of Martin Luther; and Kant study, with a special emphasis on his philosophy of law and morality, which Soloviev puts in the context of contemporary discussions in the relevant fields.","On October 14th and 15th, 2017, a conference organized by Ben Eklof (Indiana University), Igor Fedyukin (Higher School of Economics (Moscow), Tatiana Saburova (Higher School of Economics, Indiana University), Elena Vishlenkova (Higher School of Economics, Moscow) was held at the Indiana University Europe Gateway (Berlin) with the aim of seeking new approaches to the history of Russian education. As a starting point, participants were encouraged to consider the applicability to education studies of James C. Scott's book, Seeing like a State. How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1998), in particular the concept of \"high modernism\" and the effort stemming from this mindset to transform society in accordance with its tenets.","In this paper, we examine the exposure of sectoral equity returns to changes in oil risk factors among BRICS markets. The paper combines VAR model together with the Random Forest technique to provide a novel framework which overcome some weaknesses in VAR modelling and help in the selection of oil-risk factors considered. Our results in general show that the response of sectoral stocks to changes in oil-risk factors is not homogenous and their sensitivities are not uniform across BRICS markets. Stock returns of Basic Materials, Financials and Industrials sectors show consistently negative sensitivity to crude oil volatility (OVX) and oil price shocks for major oil importers, whereas sectoral stocks among major oil exporters seems to demonstrate systematic pattern. To explain sectoral stock variations, the results reveal OVX and oil to be the most significant risk transmitting factors in BRICS, irrespective of whether the market is a major oil importer or exporter. However, our results also confirm the presence of asymmetric effects in sectoral stocks for Brazil and Russia while no such evidence is found for India, China and South Africa. Overall, the findings suggest that the manner in which sectors respond to fluctuations in oil-risk factors varies between different sectors and it depends on the oil characteristics of the markets, nature of sectors and the type of oil-risk factors considered.

We find evidence that investors on the Moscow Exchange herd without any reference to fundamentals during unanticipated financial crises coupled with high uncertainty, in falling markets, and during days with extreme upward oil price movements. In contrast, in periods of high liquidity and on days of international sanction announcements during the Ukrainian crisis, herding behaviour is merely driven by fundamentals. In Russia, macroeconomic news releases induce both information-related herding and herding without any reference to fundamentals. These results suggest that motives of investors' herding behaviour vary under specific market conditions such as market trends, liquidity, uncertainty, arrival of new information, and oil price volatility.","Despite the fact that judicial review is an important part of competition law enforcement under the administrative system, in which courts decide on claims to annul infringement decisions made by competition authorities, its role in the development of evidentiary standards of economic analysis is understudied. This paper attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the impact of judicial review on the application of market analysis in competition investigations by the Russian competition authority during 2008-2015. Although the guidelines for the assessment of competition are mandatory for many types of anticompetitive conducts and they require application of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test to delineate antitrust market, competition authority does not always do that. We test hypotheses on the impact of legal requirements, experience of application, and the outcomes of the judicial review on the probability to present either an informal market analysis or market delineation using the Hypothetical Monopolist Test in a particular decision. We find that positive outcomes of the judicial review of infringement decisions significantly increase the probability of undertaking a particular analysis in future investigations. The pressure of judicial review under the presence of mandatory standards of evidence is an important determinant of the development of evidentiary standards in competition law.

Our article shows that the reach and scope of digitization in Russia is lesser than that of European museums. Digitization is mainly done in Russia for inventory purposes. The share of digitized objects published online is comparable to that in Europe if we consider images published on museum websites; however, much content from Russia is not licensed as reusable, partly due to the different legal framework that exists there. The article challenges the perceptions that global heritage collections are becoming more visible and accessible. It shows that future digital analysis of cultural heritage may be only possible with corpora of images provided by museums that publish numerous images from their digital collections online while pursuing the policies of free image reuse alongside open licensing. Such corpora may not be found beyond a limited number of Western collections, which may result in excluding many cultures from humanities research.","Aims and objectives: The main objective of this study is to find evidence for the Linguistic Proximity Model, which allows for facilitative and non-facilitative cross-linguistic influence (CLI) from all previously known languages in third language (L3) acquisition. We target CLI in L3 English based on bilingual heritage speakers (Russian-German and Turkish-German) in comparison with second language acquisition of monolingual German speakers. Methodology: We examine the outcome of an English word order test. The participants produced sentences based on randomly ordered words. The focus of this study is the placement of direct and indirect pronominal objects with varying ditransitive verbs. Data analysis: 195 students in school years 7 and 9, separated into three language groups, participated in the study: German monolinguals (n(G7) = 47; n(G9) = 64), Russian-German bilinguals (n(R7) = 19; n(R9) = 30) and Turkish-German bilinguals (n(T7) = 19; n(T9) = 16). The placement of pronominal objects in the sentence task is compared to results from equivalent word order tests in English, German, Russian and Turkish that were repeated with native speakers. Findings: We find some support for the Linguistic Proximity Model because the outcome shows that facilitative and non-facilitative CLI is possible from both the heritage language and the majority language. Determining factors are the background languages, the age of the participants and frequency. However, the majority language, German, displays the strongest influence of both background languages due to its dominant status. Originality: This study provides further support for the Linguistic Proximity Model, by using a sentence completion task with unbalanced bilingual heritage speakers.","The intent to totally reconstruct society and human identity was a basic notion of the Soviet project. Funerals and the death care industry were no exception. The Decree on Funerals and Cemeteries on 7 December 1918 stated the need to construct a new funeral rite based on a new death care industry: the radical escape from Orthodox ritual tradition, an 'equal' funeral rite for every citizen, new 'un-religious' funeral practices, and, finally, the 'fiery burial' - cremation - as a most perfect burial, both ideologically and aesthetically. This new 'death care policy' also included the nationalization of the private death care industry and guarantees for any working person to be properly buried at the state's expense. The practical implementation of these ideas, however, resulted in the immediate and total collapse of the death care industry in early Soviet Russia. This article depicts the early efforts of the Bolshevik regime in the radical and thorough reforming of the death care industry in Russia, and it discusses how the aftermath of these activities and the costs of the 'new death administration' ended in the quiet restoration of pre-revolutionary death procedures. It also argues that the implementation of class-based funeral fees in 1923 was one of the first steps towards creating new Soviet social estates that became official in the Soviet passport system in 1932.","The Sputnik flight caused great concern in the West, as it brought into question its technological lead over the Soviet bloc. This article discusses the impact of the Sputnik flight on NATO. It argues that NATO reactions were far from being alarmist. The impact was mostly political and psychological, as it tended to undermine the Europeans' confidence to the US deterrence and thus threaten the unequal alliance's very unity. This threat was swiftly and effectively met by the holding of the December 1957 summit, the first in the alliance's history, and the decision to install US IRBMs in Europe. On other levels, the Sputnik flight played the role of a catalyst, accelerating processes which were already under way, such as the planning for a new alliance military doctrine, and the setting up of the NATO Science Committee. Thus, this article examines the ways that a scientific event can affect the workings of a military alliance, and argues that technology can be profoundly political. The study of NATO's responses needs to take into account the alliance's nature, functions and constraints, and mostly its inter-governmental character.","The objective of our paper is to explore the extent to which the research collaborations could be an impact on the scientific performance of academic institutions. The analysis is based on data for 241 universities in Russia for 2015-2016 obtained from different sources: Interfax (privately held independent major news agency in Russia) National Ranking of Universities, monitoring of efficiency of activity of educational organizations of higher education (launched by Information-Computing Centre of Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation), and Russian Science Citation Index (largest Russian information and analytical portal in science, technology, medicine, and education and electronic library of scientific publications with 28 mlns of documents). We consider the number of citations of publications to evaluate university performance in Russia. To this end, we develop a non-overlapping generation model to evidence the theoretical idea of research externalities between academic institutions. Moreover, we implement different empirical models to test for the effect of external scientific collaborations on the institutional research quality by Federal District and scientific field. The results confirm an important positive impact of co-authoring process.","Andrei Tarkovsky's film Stalker is often understood as both a cinematic masterpiece and an impenetrable mystery. The source text, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel, Roadside Picnic, provides clues to interpretation as well as insights into the evolution of motifs from book to screenplay. By subjecting the texts to a critical reading inspired by Alain Badiou's philosophy of the event - itself considered enigmatic - this article elucidates novel, film, and philosophy, connecting such shared themes as desire, fidelity, militancy, and truth.","Relying on a wide range of literary history sources covering the first third of the twentieth century, especially publications in pedagogical and literary periodicals, this article examines the reception Russian critics gave to one of the most popular female Russian children's writers, Lidiia Charskaia. Attitudes of prerevolutionary and Soviet critics toward Charskaia's works are compared, and an analysis is offered of the main principles and techniques applied in criticism of children's literature.","The North Pacific is a sea area of primary interest to Russia, which inherited key strategic interests of the former Soviet Union. But the North Pacific has also become an area of increasing resource exploitation activity. These factors lead to an even more active involvement in regional political relations. The article touches on a number of most urgent, controversial, and still unsolved issues faced today by the Russian Federation. The author concentrates on two major problems: the issue of international fisheries in the so-called doughnut hole (located in the central Bering Sea), and the highly controversial questions of marine spaces delimitation between Russia on one side and Japan (which raises a more general political question of sovereignty over the four southernmost islands of the Kuril chain) and the United States on the other","Assuming that every utterance has some sort of syntactic 'deep structure', data from Colloquial Russian suggest that a restrained interlocutor relationship results, iconically, in a 'grammar of restraint'; the 'grammar of closeness', on the contrary, operates as a creative superstructure above the well-established and obligatory 'grammar of restraint'. An alternative solution would be to posit two different sub-grammars: (a) an analytic and explicit 'grammar of restraint', generating pirmarily hypotactic structures, and (b) an undifferentiated 'grammar of closeness', generating primarily paratactic structures.","A prominent American specialist on Soviet and Russian affairs presents the results of surveys conducted among foreign policy elites (N=200) and the general population (N=1,243) in European Russia in 1993. Survey instruments tapped attitudes toward economic, political, and foreign policy issues, including foreign economic relations and integration into the global economy. Results demonstrate substantial differences between elites and the general public on all three sets of issues, as well as unexpected relationships between domestic and foreign policy attitudes within both samples. Journal of Economic Literature, Classification Numbers: H19, P23.","Numeral phrases in Russian display many unusual morphosyntactic properties, e.g., (i) the numeral sometimes assigns genitive (GEN-Q) to the following noun and sometimes agrees with it and (ii) the numeral phrase sometimes induces subject-verb agreement and sometimes does not.  In this paper existing analyses of these properties are parametrized to accommodate related phenomena in other Slavic languages.  First, Babby's (1987) proposal that GEN-Q is structural in Russian is shown not to extend to Serbo-Croatian, where it must be analyzed as inherent.  Second, Pesetsky's (1982) idea that Russian numeral phrases may be either QPs or NPs also does not extend to Serbo-Croatian, where these are only NPs.  This set of assumptions explains a range of seemingly unrelated facts about the behavior of numeral phrases in the two languages.  Pesetsky's analysis is recast in terms of more recent hypotheses about phrase structure:  (i) NPs are actually embedded in DPs and (ii) subjects are D-Structure VP-specifiers.  Proposal (i) allows for a more explanatory analysis of GEN-Q assignment and proposal (ii) accounts for several distinctions between QP and NP subjects within Russian, also motivating the absence of these distinctions in Serbo-Croatian.  Finally, it is shown that Polish can be assimilated to the proposed system.","This paper begins to fill the void of information about dachas in Russia by drawing on household surveys conducted in seven cities between November 1993 and January 1994. Based on these data, it appears that dachas are a common phenomenon-about one urban family in four has one, with the incidence fairly stable across cities. At the same time, these dachas range from very modest, simple structures to the elegant country house, with the clear majority at the more basic end of the spectrum. While only a small share of dachas are note used during the winter, nearly half of all owners of seasonal-use dachas stated they definitely want to improve their unit for winter use. It seems possible that as upgrading proceeds some dachas will be converted to add to the permanent housing stock.","This paper examines the impact of human capital (the number of working age household members), social capital (social exchange helping networks and community integration), technological capital (use of mechanical agricultural tools), and village of residence on stratification of Russian peasant households in the post-Soviet era. Findings from a 1995 survey of households in three Russian villages show that the number of working age adults in the household has the strongest influence on household agricultural production. Social capital and technological capital also are associated with differences in the amount of sales obtained from household production. One village, which is located in an oblast (province) which has a program to assist peasant households had substantially higher agricultural production than did the other two villages which are located in oblasti without such programs. The number of working age adults in the household, social exchange networks, and community attachment are negatively associated with symptoms of stress, while higher village levels of production are associated with higher average levels of symptoms of stress in the village. The implications of the findings for the future of Russian agriculture and Russian rural village life are discussed.","The environmental deterioration of the Danube River basin calls for unprecedented cooperation among the ten riparian and seven non-riparian basin countries, the majority of which are undergoing major economic and political transformations after the breakup of the Soviet Union. This paper discusses the recent legal and institutional developments along with the political hurdles leading to a post-Soviet regime for managing the Danube River and promoting sustainable development in the basin. After reviewing the geography and ecology, the conflicts and political issues of the Danube, the current efforts at building cooperative institutions are discussed. The question whether the Danube will be exclusively the responsibility of the basin countries, will include the Russian Federation and other countries of the Black Sea, or will be the responsibility of pan-European institutions in close connection with the European Union is addressed.","During the 1990s, Russia underwent an extraordinary transformation from a communist dictatorship to a multi-party democracy, from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, and from a belligerent adversary of the West to a cooperative partner. Yet a consensus in the US circa 2000 viewed Russia as a disastrous and threatening failure, and the 1990s as a decade of catastrophe for its citizens. Analyzing a variety of economic and political data, we demonstrate a large gap between this perception and the facts. In contrast to the common image, by the late 1990s Russia had become a typical middle-income capitalist democracy.","This article reports the results of observations of management practices in 20 Russian manufacturing subsidiaries of Western multinational corporations (MNCs). I argue that to counterbalance the higher country-specific risks associated with investing in Russia, MNCs impose on their Russian subsidiaries high demands for superior performance in terms of both technical and economic efficiency. My observations confirm that in most cases such demands are successfully met by the implementation of highly effective practices. Thus I challenge several beliefs about industrial management in Russia, including the myths that Russian firms are hostile towards knowledge sharing and are wary of talent.","The standard narrative of Russia's \"authoritarian backsliding\" fails to grapple with the tremendous variation in subnational politics that emerged over the past two decades. This article offers a case study of the industrial city of Volzhskiy, which, although once a stalwart supporter of the Communist Party (KPRF), has evolved into a highly pluralistic system with democratic municipal institutions. Drawing upon analysis of local publications, protest data, and interviews with local politicians, this article traces the interplay of formal institutions and informal political processes in Volzhskiy's local-level transition to democracy. Volzhskiy's pluralism and local democratic outcome can largely be explained by (1) the emergence of a more diverse set of economic and political interests and constituencies, and (2) a KPRF organization that was strong and provided robust competition that created the conditions for cooperation among the competitors to form fair and open local political institutions, which fostered the city's pluralism.","This article brings to light the professional life of Dmitrii Vasil'evich Mileev (1878-1914), one of the leading Russian architects and architectural restorationists of the twentieth century. For various reasons, Mileev's work has not received much attention in Russian scholarly literature, and this article seeks to fill this gap by delving into the archives and publications of the Imperial Architectural Commission, as well as using other documents from the early 1900s. The focus is on the restoration of wooden architectural monuments of the Russian North, since Mileev was the first Russian architect to work out a systematic method of preservation that he followed while working on over fifty such buildings. The article continues its exploration into the Soviet period, taking note in particular of the theoretical and practical work of A. V. Opolovnikov, who continued Mileev's work. Together, their contribution to Russian culture was priceless, and their legacy helped to set the course for future Soviet restorationist efforts.","The debate on Russia's innovation performance has paid little attention to the role of geography. This article addresses this gap by integrating an evolutionary dimension in an augmented regional knowledge production function framework to examine the territorial dynamics of knowledge creation in Russia. The empirical analysis identifies a strong link between regional research and development (R&D) expenditure and patenting performance. However, R&D appears inadequately connected to regional human capital. Conversely, multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a fundamental role as global knowledge pipelines. The incorporation of historic variables reveals that the Russian case is a striking example of long-term path dependency in regional patterns of knowledge generation. Endowment with Soviet-founded science cities remains a strong predictor of current patenting. However, current innovation drivers and policies also concur to enhance (or hinder) innovation performance in all regions. The alignment of regional innovation efforts, exposure to localized knowledge flows and injections of foreign knowledge channeled by MNEs make path renewal and path creation possible, opening new windows of locational opportunity.","The article examines the organisational transformation of the Russian defence industry during the period of privatisation and radical market reforms. The study is based on the results of an original large-scale longitudinal survey of the directors (CEOs) of the industry. We find that over a decade of transition, 1996-2006, Russian defence industry managers were able largely to preserve the production potential of their enterprises and make them capable of operating under market conditions. Coupled with the restoration of government orders and the 2020 rearmament programme, these newly acquired market skills have contributed to the impressive revival of the Russian defence industry in the Putin era.","This paper analyses Russia's view of its involvement in international space cooperation and the Western concerns associated with this. In the current economic and political situation the Russian administration and space industry are eager to take part in all kinds of international space activity, which is seen as an opportunity to sustain the country's scientific and technological potential. Russia claims a fair share in both commercial space operations and joint space development programmes, appropriate to its capabilities as the world's number two space power. Western concerns about Russian interference in its policy and the problems involved in dealing with Russia should be solvable and are less dangerous than reverting to a situation of confrontation.","Vygotsky and the Russian cultural-historical school offer an alternative psychology well suited to anthropological studies of culture and mind. This is the case even though their 1920s understanding of ''culture'' needs reformulation. Here we argue strongly for the school's recognition of mediation through cultural artifact as the foundation of human mental and emotional activity. At the same time we begin to rework a more contemporary notion of culture, using both discourse and schema theory to flesh out a novel concept of cultural artifact. We suggest that the outcome of this reworking also provides a bridge between these two, seemingly exclusive approaches to the study of cultural forms."],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,null,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,0,1,-1,-1,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,1,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,1,1,1,-1,1,-1,1],[-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0,-1,1,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,1,1,0,1,-1,0],["```json\n{\n  \"abstract_id\": \"WOS:000165243300002\",\n  \"classification_type\": \"N4\",\n  \"actor_or_object_targeted\": \"Proponents of mass privatization in Russia, managers and controlling shareholders of privatized enterprises, 'crooks'\",\n  \"key_phrases_and_markers\": [\n    \"selling control of its largest enterprises cheaply to crooks\",\n    \"transferred their skimming talents\",\n    \"used their wealth to further corrupt the government\"\n  ],\n  \"justification\": \"The abstract uses extreme, pejorative language ('crooks', 'skimming talents') and direct accusations of criminal activity and corruption, indicating a hostile and sensational tone that goes far beyond academic neutrality.\"\n}\n```","```json\n{\n  \"abstract_id\": \"WOS:000166486700004\",\n  \"classification_type\": \"N1\",\n  \"actor_or_object_targeted\": \"Soviet financial system\",\n  \"key_phrases_and_markers\": [\n    \"informal mechanisms\",\n    \"soft budget constraints\",\n    \"massive moral hazards\"\n  ],\n  \"justification\": \"The abstract uses technical terminology like 'soft budget constraints' and 'moral hazards' to describe systemic issues, constituting a technical critique without explicit moral judgment or emotional framing.\"\n}\n```","```json\n{\n  \"abstract_id\": \"WOS:000169055500004\",\n  \"classification_type\": \"N2\",\n  \"actor_or_object_targeted\": \"Japanese-Russian relations and negotiations\",\n  \"key_phrases_and_markers\": [\n    \"rapid improvement\",\n    \"high expectations\",\n    \"stalemate\"\n  ],\n  \"justification\": \"The abstract uses terms like 'high expectations' and 'stalemate' to frame the narrative of the Japanese-Russian relations, implying a problem or disappointment without explicit moral judgment.
